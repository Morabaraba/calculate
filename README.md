## Calculate

For the first attempt at this exercise please see the other [branch](//github.com/Morabaraba/calculate/tree/first-exercise).

### Goals

- [ ] Create a calculator.
- [ ] Model a basic calculator using a state machine and python.
- [ ] Model a basic calculator using a state machine and javascript.
- [ ] Create a front-end for the modeled calculator.
- [ ] Allow the front-end to interact with a back-end modeled calculator.

### Why

I was recently given a task to create a back-end and front-end for a calculator that interacts with each other in a boxed time-limit of 2 hours. While this seemed like a reasonable request at the time, I soon realised the devil is in the details. So this is a second attempt with a relaxed timeframe and thought out process.
